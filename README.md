# Playlist Assistant

Java MVC web-application on servlets, that uses PostgreSQL via JDBC. This app is used to suggest new songs for you, analyzing your musical preferences.
As of 11/25/2022, the site is hosting in the Google Cloud and available at: https://playlist-assistant-369622.oa.r.appspot.com/

## Technical notes

The application uses artists and tracks data from public APIs, such as: iTunes, LastFM and Deezer. 
Architecture - Monolith. In the case of a possible transition to a microservice architecture, such modules can be distinguished: 
  - Infrastructure (work with database)
  - Parser (receiving JSON information with API and subsequent mapping)
  - Playlist Assistant (an service that generates suitable playlist based on selected artists).
The project uses caching to avoid frequent requests to third-party APIs. To update the list of current artists, there is a background daily task.
