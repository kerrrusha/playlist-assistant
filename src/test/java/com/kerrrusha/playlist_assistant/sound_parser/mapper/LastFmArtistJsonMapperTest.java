On 7 October 2020, the band confirmed the upcoming release on 13 November 2020 of their new studio album, Power Up, and released the first single taken from it, \\\"Shot in the Dark\\\". The album's track listing was revealed on their website via a spinning promotional album. Angus Young also noted that the new album, as was Rock or Bust, is dedicated to Malcolm Young, much in the same way that Back in Black was dedicated to Bon Scott.\\n\\nAC/DC has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 75 million albums in the United States, making them the ninth highest-selling artist in the United States and the 16th best selling artist worldwide. Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it the third highest-selling album by any artist, and the highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 22 million units in the US, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the \\\"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\\\" and was named the seventh \\\"Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time\\\" by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the \\\"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\\\". Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as \\\"the greatest rock and roll band of all time\\\". In 2010, VH1 ranked AC/DC number 23 in its list of the \\\"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\\\".\\n\\nAC/DC was a somewhat formative influence on the new wave of British heavy metal bands who emerged in the late 1970s, such as Saxon and Iron Maiden, in part as a reaction to the decline of traditional early 1970s hard rock bands. In 2007, critics noted that AC/DC, along with Thin Lizzy, UFO, Scorpions, and Judas Priest, were among \\\"the second generation of rising stars ready to step into the breach as the old guard waned.\\\"\\n\\nAC/DC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 10 March 2003. <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

On 7 October 2020, the band confirmed the upcoming release on 13 November 2020 of their new studio album, Power Up, and released the first single taken from it, \\\"Shot in the Dark\\\". The album's track listing was revealed on their website via a spinning promotional album. Angus Young also noted that the new album, as was Rock or Bust, is dedicated to Malcolm Young, much in the same way that Back in Black was dedicated to Bon Scott.\\n\\nAC/DC has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 75 million albums in the United States, making them the ninth highest-selling artist in the United States and the 16th best selling artist worldwide. Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it the third highest-selling album by any artist, and the highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 22 million units in the US, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the \\\"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\\\" and was named the seventh \\\"Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time\\\" by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the \\\"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\\\". Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as \\\"the greatest rock and roll band of all time\\\". In 2010, VH1 ranked AC/DC number 23 in its list of the \\\"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\\\".\\n\\nAC/DC was a somewhat formative influence on the new wave of British heavy metal bands who emerged in the late 1970s, such as Saxon and Iron Maiden, in part as a reaction to the decline of traditional early 1970s hard rock bands. In 2007, critics noted that AC/DC, along with Thin Lizzy, UFO, Scorpions, and Judas Priest, were among \\\"the second generation of rising stars ready to step into the breach as the old guard waned.\\\"\\n\\nAC/DC was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 10 March 2003. <a href=\\\"https://www.last.fm/music/AC%2FDC\\\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
